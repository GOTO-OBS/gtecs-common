**G-TeCS** (*gee-teks*) is the **Te**lescope **C**ontrol **S**ystem for the **G**OTO observatory. This package (`gtecs-common`) contains common functions and utilities that are used by other G-TeCS packages.

Note this module is Python3 only and has been developed for Linux, otherwise use at your own risk.

## Requirements

This common package doesn't require any of the other G-TeCS packages to be installed, but it itself is a requirement of several of them.

## Installation

Once you've downloaded or cloned the repository, in the base directory run:

    pip3 install . --user

You should then be able to import the module from within Python.
